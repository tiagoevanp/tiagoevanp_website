Semantics
=========

Semantics in HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that carry meaning about the type of content they wrap, both for the browser and the developer.

In other words, it's about using the right tag for the right content.

Example of non-semantic HTML:

```html
<div id="header">
    <div class="big-title">My Awesome Website</div>
</div>
<div id="nav">
    <div class="link">Home</div>
    <div class="link">About</div>
</div>
<div id="main-content">
    <div class="article">
        <div class="title">Article Title</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This is a paragraph <span class="bold">very important</span>.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="footer">
    <div class="text">Copyright 2024</div>
</div>
```

To the browser, everything is just a div. It doesn't know what is a header, a navigation section, or the main article. Screen readers for visually impaired people will have difficulty navigating. Search engines (Google) don't understand the structure and importance of the content.

Example of semantic HTML (same content):

```html
<header>
    <h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
</header>
<nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<main>
    <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph <strong>very important</strong>.</p>
    </article>
</main>
<footer>
    <p>Copyright 2024</p>
</footer>
```

Now screen readers can identify: "Here is the main header", "Here begins the navigation menu", "Here is the main content", "Here is an article". This allows users to navigate the website efficiently.

Search engines give more weight to content inside tags like `<h1>`, `<article>`, and `<main>`. They understand the hierarchical structure and relevance of your content, which can improve your positioning in search results.

For developers, it's much easier to understand and maintain code where `<nav>` means "navigation" and `<footer>` means "footer" than a sea of `<div id="nav">` and `<div id="footer">`. There is a universal agreement about what each semantic tag represents. This makes the code more predictable and readable for any developer in the world.

<Footer next={{title: 'aria', href: 'aria'}}/>
